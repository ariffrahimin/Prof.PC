They are also where a player serves behind.\nCenter Mark - The center mark determines the two halves of the tennis court. It mainly helps with service to determine where a player should stand prior to serving.\nCenter Line - The center line divides the two service boxes into a distinct left service box and right service box on either side of the court. Landing a serve on the line is considered good.\nNet - The net stands 3 feet and 6 inches high where the posts lie while the middle of the net is 3 feet tall, with the posts 3 feet outside of the court on either side. Hitting a ball into the net is considered an out while any ball that hits the net cord and falls onto the other side is considered good except for a serve, which allows for a re-do, or let.\nService Line - The service line separates the forecourt from the back court, and it also marks the length of the service box.\nSingles Sideline - The singles sideline is the innermost line running lengthwise and determines the boundary of play for singles matches as well as the width of the service box.\nDoubles Sideline - The doubles sideline is the outermost line running lengthwise and is only used in doubles matches."],

You are allowed an infinite amount of lets, although it does not happen often.\nOrder of Service - The player/team who wins the toss serves first (team that wins chooses which player serves). If playing singles matches, players alternate between serving and receiving every game. If playing doubles matches, teams alternate between serving and receiving every game, with each player on a team getting the chance to serve before the cycle repeats.\nSwitching Sides - Players/teams switch sides for every odd-numbered game (so, games 3, 5, 7 etc.)"],
